
### Echo Args (Java)

by: Keith Fenske, https://kwfenske.github.io/

EchoArgs is a trivial Java 1.4 console application to print all command-line
parameters on standard error, when debugging scripts or what MS-DOS calls
"batch" files. Invoke this program instead of a real Java application until you
are certain that a command file (script) is passing the correct arguments.
EchoArgs may be the smallest Java program that does something useful.

There is no graphical interface (GUI) for this program; it must be run from a
command prompt, command shell, or terminal window.
